# ROV20_autonomous_mapping
- This repository contains python code for task 2.1 of the 2020 Expolorer MATE ROV Competition. The task involves autonomously flying a transect line over a coral reef and mapping points of interest.
- The code stitches input images together, crops the area outside the coral reef, and recognizes and maps the points of interest on the reef. For more information about the task, refer to the 2020 MATE ROV COMPETITION EXPLORER Manual at https://www.rovegypt.org/technical_support.
- An example running the code is shown in the Data folder, where 3 input images are used to produce the map of the points of interest on the coral reef.
